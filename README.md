# DoggoReportBot

Telegram bot, which allows admins of a channel to communicate with users through the bot.

I have ignored some files from github. Those include data I won't disclose publicly.
If you're using this, then you might want to recreate those files in your local machine after you clone the repository.

The files I've ignored are visible in the .gitignore file. So just take a look at that.
